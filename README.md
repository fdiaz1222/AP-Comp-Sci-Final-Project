## Final Portfolio Project â€“ Fernando D.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Fernando D., a junior at Mt. Eden High School in Hayward, California. This year, I embarked on a journey into programming through AP Computer Science Principles. Initially, it was challenging to grasp new concepts and languages, but with perseverance and practice, I developed a solid understanding of coding fundamentals. I began with C++, then transitioned to HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, culminating in the creation of this portfolio website to showcase my projects.

## About This Project

This portfolio represents the culmination of my learning and growth throughout the year. It features three interactive games developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project presented unique challenges, from debugging to implementing game logic, providing invaluable hands-on experience in programming and problem-solving.

## Portfolio Overview

My portfolio site includes:

- An introduction to who I am and my journey into programming
- Navigation to featured projects with descriptions and links to source code
- Highlights of the skills and tools I've utilized
- A clean, user-friendly design reflecting my development as a programmer

## Featured Projects

### 1. **Tic Tac Toe Game**
A classic Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project introduced me to JavaScript and game logic, allowing me to create a functional and interactive game board.

### 2. **Memory Game**
A memory matching game developed using JavaScript. This project reinforced my understanding of JavaScript and provided an opportunity to enhance my styling and design skills.

### 3. **Connect Four**
A fully functional Connect Four game created without the aid of tutorials. This challenging project involved complex game logic and deepened my problem-solving abilities.
